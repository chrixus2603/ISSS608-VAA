# What Will I Learn?

Visualising uncertainty is relatively new in statistical graphics. In this hands-on exercise, I will gain hands-on experience on creating statistical graphics for visualising uncertainty. By the end of this chapter you will be able:

-   to plot statistics error bars by using ggplot2,

-   to plot interactive error bars by combining ggplot2, plotly and DT,

-   to create advanced by using ggdist, and

-   to create hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) by using ungeviz package.

# Getting Started

## Loading the R packages

For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,

-   plotly for creating interactive plot,

-   gganimate for creating animation plot,

-   DT for displaying interactive html table,

-   crosstalk for for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering), and

-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ungeviz, plotly, crosstalk,
               DT, ggdist, ggridges,
               colorspace, gganimate, tidyverse)
```

## Importing data

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods

A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval.

Firstly, code chunk below will be used to derive the necessary summary statistics.

```{r}
my_sum <- exam %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

::: callout-tip
## Things to learn from the code chunk above

-   `group_by()` of **dplyr** package is used to group the observation by RACE,

-   `summarise()` is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation

-   `mutate()` is used to derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   the output is save as a tibble data table called *my_sum*.
:::

Next, the code chunk below will be used to display *my_sum* tibble data frame in an html table format.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

## Plotting standard error bars of point estimates

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean maths score by rac")
```

-   The error bars are computed by using the formula mean+/-se.

-   For `geom_point()`, it is important to indicate *stat="identity"*.

## Plotting confidence interval of point estimates

Instead of plotting the standard error bar of point estimates, we can also plot the confidence intervals of mean maths score by race.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
        ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
        ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  labs(x = "Maths score",
       title = "95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```

-   The confidence intervals are computed by using the formula mean+/-1.96\*se.

-   The error bars is sorted by using the average maths scores.

-   `labs()` argument of ggplot2 is used to change the x-axis label.

## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars

Below is the plot of interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race.

```{r}
shared_df = SharedData$new(my_sum)

bscols(widths = c(4,8),
       ggplotly((ggplot(shared_df) +
                   geom_errorbar(aes(
                     x=reorder(RACE, -mean),
                     ymin=mean-2.58*se, 
                     ymax=mean+2.58*se), 
                     width=0.2, 
                     colour="black", 
                     alpha=0.9, 
                     size=0.5) +
                   geom_point(aes(
                     x=RACE, 
                     y=mean, 
                     text = paste("Race:", `RACE`, 
                                  "<br>N:", `n`,
                                  "<br>Avg. Scores:", round(mean, digits = 2),
                                  "<br>95% CI:[", 
                                  round((mean-2.58*se), digits = 2), ",",
                                  round((mean+2.58*se), digits = 2),"]")),
                     stat="identity", 
                     color="red", 
                     size = 1.5, 
                     alpha=1) + 
                   xlab("Race") + 
                   ylab("Average Scores") + 
                   theme_minimal() + 
                   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
                     angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
                   ggtitle("99% Confidence interval of average /<br>maths scores by race")), 
                tooltip = "text"), 
       DT::datatable(shared_df, 
                     rownames = FALSE, 
                     class="compact", 
                     width="100%", 
                     options = list(pageLength = 10,
                                    scrollX=T), 
                     colnames = c("No. of pupils", 
                                  "Avg Scores",
                                  "Std Dev",
                                  "Std Error")) %>%
         formatRound(columns=c('mean', 'sd', 'se'),
                     digits=2))
```

# Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package

![](images/ggdist.png)

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions

## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods

In the code chunk below, **stat_pointinterval()** of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

This function comes with many arguments. For example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:

-   .width = 0.95

-   .point = median

-   .interval = qi

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of median math score",
    subtitle = "Median Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(
    show.legend = FALSE) +   
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods

In the code chunk below, **stat_gradientinterval()** of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

## Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)

Step 1: Installing ungeviz package

```         
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

Note: This step is only needed to be performed once.

Step 2: Launch the application in R

```{r}
library(ungeviz)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, color = "#0072B2", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, group = RACE), height = 0.6, color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  # `.draw` is a generated column indicating the sample draw
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), 
            y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, 
    width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, 
    color = "#0072B2", 
    alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, 
                             group = RACE), 
              height = 0.6, 
              color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)
```
